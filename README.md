Chinese New Year 2016 - Year of the Monkey Card & Game
======================================================

This is a combination Chinese New Year greeting card and mini video game to
celebrate the Year of the Monkey. It's a tradition of mine!

Gameplay:
* The CNY2016 game is meant to be played on a web browser. Open index.html in
  Chrome, Firefox or etc.
* The game uses a touchscreen for mobile devices and the up/down/left/right keys
  for laptops and desktops.
* Swipe up/press the up key to start the game.
* Slide your finger on the screen/press the arrow keys to move the monkey.
* Bananas good. Spikes bad. Vines climbable.
* Collect as many bananas as you can before you inevitably get hit by a falling
  spike or unceremoniously fall off the screen.
